asnowmang's Fortran 77 PostScript Library

#### About
This is a very small incomplete PostScript library I wrote for Fortran 77. It
was both written for practice and so I could know exactly how the library
functioned and be able to more fully utilize it. So far I've only used it to 
pipe output into .ps files, e.g.
% ./main > main.ps

#### Example
    **Fortran 77            **PostScript output
    CALL PS               %!PS
    CALL NLINE	      newline
    CALL MVTO(72, 72)      72  72 moveto
    CALL LNTO(144, 144)   144 144 lineto
    CALL STROKE           stroke
    CALL SHOWPG           showpage

#### Compiling and installing the library
Use make to build it or run the following commands. The makefile defaults to 
/usr/lib/ for installation.
    % gfortran -std=legacy -c *.f
    % ar rcv fPS.a *.o
    % ranlib fPS.a

#### Compiling programs that use the library (given lib file is in directory)
    % gfortran -std=legacy main.f fPS.a -o main
